Tied into this idea of using local materials is the concept of sustainability, which is always an undercurrent in my work. I mainly work with recycled metal and glass.  Most of the art I create is functional and many of my large metal and glass pieces serve as light fixtures.” I am passionate about public art because they allow art to reach more people than just those who can afford to purchase professional art.
