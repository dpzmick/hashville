I want the rack to clearly communicate it is available to the public for the purpose of locking bicycles. I also wanted to create something that reminds the public that biking is a great healthy, environmentally-friendly way to commute and explore our city. In addition, I like the idea that the materials for this rack are sourced locally. Tied into this idea of using local materials is the concept of sustainability, which is always an undercurrent in my work. I mainly work with recycled metal and glass.  Most of the art I create is functional and many of my large metal and glass pieces serve as light fixtures.” I am passionate about public art because they allow art to reach more people than just those who can afford to purchase professional art.
